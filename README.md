  # CommunityMesh

## Overview:

CommunityMesh is a project aimed at creating a resilient and connected community through the utilization of solar-powered communication networks. It is designed to empower individuals to support each other during times of crisis and promote self-sustainability.

## Features:

- **Solar-Powered Communication Network:** Utilizes solar energy to power a decentralized communication network, ensuring connectivity even in the event of power outages or disruptions.

## Getting Started:

To set up the CommunityMesh project on your ESP32 microcontroller, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Requirements:**
   - ESP32 microcontroller board
   - LoRa module (if not already integrated into the ESP32 board)
   - Solar panels and batteries for power supply

2. **Software Requirements:**
   - Arduino IDE installed on your computer

3. **Installation:**
   - Connect the LoRa module to the ESP32 microcontroller board if it's not already integrated.
   - Install the necessary libraries in the Arduino IDE:
     - LoRa library
     - WiFi library (if not using LoRa exclusively)
   - Download the CommunityMesh code from the repository.

4. **Configuration:**
   - Open the CommunityMesh code in the Arduino IDE.
   - If using WiFi, specify the SSID and password of your WiFi network in the code.
   - Configure any other settings as needed for your specific setup.

5. **Upload:**
   - Connect the ESP32 microcontroller board to your computer via USB.
   - Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
   - Click the "Upload" button to compile and upload the code to the ESP32 board.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the ESP32 microcontroller board in the desired location within your community.
   - Ensure that the solar panels are properly positioned to receive sunlight for power.

7. **Testing:**
   - Power on the ESP32 board and verify that it connects to the network (either LoRa or WiFi).
   - Test the communication functionality by sending and receiving messages using the CommunityMesh network.
